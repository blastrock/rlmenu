# What is slmenu?

slmenu is a simple popup main menu to launch your applications. I found no
other project doing only that, so I decided do make my own.

Most of the code comes from adeskbar and the python-gmenu example. I am not a
Python expert nor a python-gi expert so the code may need improvements. The
hidden window could be removed for example but I couldn't find how.

# Installation

Dependencies:

- python-gmenu
- python-gi ?

Copy slmenu.py in your path, give it execution permission and it should work.

# Licensing

Since most of the code comes from [adeskbar](http://adeskbar.tuxfamily.org/)
which is under [GPL3 licence](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt), this
project is under the same licence.
